## About Me
I have been studying computer science since 2020 and joined SNHUâ€™s Computer Science program in January 2024. I work full time as a hospital pharmacy technician while pursuing my degree, and recently became a father. My long-term career goals include combining my technical skills with my healthcare background, focusing on secure systems and IT support in pharmacy and healthcare.
