# Matthew McNasby – Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my capstone ePortfolio for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This site showcases the work I selected and enhanced as part of my final project, focusing on three core areas of computer science: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each enhancement is based on my CS-340 “Grazioso Salvare” project and is supported by a detailed narrative demonstrating my growth, decision-making, and technical skills.

##  Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my Computer Science program, I have grown from someone who was just learning the fundamentals of coding into a confident problem solver who can design, develop, and improve real software systems. Completing this ePortfolio has helped me reflect on my strengths, refine my professional goals, and demonstrate my readiness to contribute in a technical role.

My coursework gave me hands-on experience working through the full software development lifecycle, from gathering requirements and writing maintainable code to testing, debugging, and improving existing systems. I learned the importance of clear communication and collaboration, especially when writing code that others must be able to understand, extend, and review. Through courses like CS-260 and CS-340, I developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, database integration, and backend logic, and I learned how to use these components together to solve real-world problems.

I also strengthened my security mindset, which has carried over into my professional work in healthcare. Whether developing software, handling data, or reviewing system workflows, I now look for potential vulnerabilities and consider validation, error handling, and least-privilege principles as part of the design, not as an afterthought.

The artifact I enhanced for this project, my CS-340 dashboard application, allowed me to demonstrate my skills across all three required categories. By improving its software design, optimizing its query logic, and strengthening its database integration, I showcased my ability to enhance performance, improve structure, and create more resilient systems. Completing this capstone has reinforced my interest in roles that blend analytics, optimization, and secure system design. I am excited to apply these skills as I continue my career path in technology.

##  Artifact Overview

All three enhancements are based on my CS-340 Grazioso Salvare project, an interactive dashboard that connects to a MongoDB database, performs CRUD operations, visualizes animal rescue data, and displays results on a map. Each page below contains:

- A description of the enhancement
- Before/after context
- The skills demonstrated
- How the enhancement aligns with CS program outcomes

| Category | Enhancement | Link |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Software Design & Engineering | Code refactoring, modular structure, error handling, and UI improvements | **(link to `software-engineering.md`)** |
| Algorithms & Data Structures | Query builder, input validation, and efficient data handling | **(link to `algorithms.md`)** |
| Databases | Secure DB configuration, fallback handling, and improved CRUD reliability | **(link to `databases.md`)** |

##  About Me

I currently work in healthcare and have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills through process optimization, system conversions, and discrepancy investigation. I enjoy combining technical problem-solving with real operational needs, and I am pursuing a career path that includes software development, data analysis, and secure system design within healthcare or risk-focused technology roles.
