# Database Enhancement

##  Artifact Overview
This enhancement focused on the resilience, security, and reliability of the MongoDB connection behind the Grazioso Salvare dashboard.

##  Enhancement Summary
The original version assumed a working database and would crash on timeout or lookup errors. My enhancements included:

- **Safe database initialization with fallback behavior**
- **Error-handled CRUD calls with clear logging**
- **Future-ready structure for environment-based credentials**
- **Input validation before database reads**
- **Data cleanup that removes unsafe or non-serializable `_id` fields**

These changes prevent UI failure when the database is unavailable and make the dashboard more aligned with production-grade behavior.

##  Skills Demonstrated
| Skill | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Secure database mindset | Removed brittle assumptions and added guarded access |
| Defensive CRUD handling | No unhandled exceptions during reads |
| Data sanitation | Clean UI output without unsafe internal identifiers |

##  Reflection
This enhancement solidified the importance of trust-nothing database access. The biggest challenge was designing failure paths that protect UX while still surfacing meaningful logs. The result is a database layer that is cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.

**CS Outcomes Demonstrated:** Database integration, secure coding, and resilient backend design.
